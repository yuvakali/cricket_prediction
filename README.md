# Cricket Score Prediction

This project aims to predict cricket scores using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Random Forest Classifiers, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) using default libraries. The goal is to analyze historical cricket data and build predictive models that can forecast the scores of upcoming matches.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuvakali/cricket_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cricket_prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical cricket match data, including information about teams, players, venues, innings, scores, and other relevant features. The dataset can be downloaded from [examplelink.com](https://examplelink.com).

After downloading the dataset, place it in the `data/` directory of the project.

## Usage

To run the prediction models, execute the following command:


This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the models using different algorithms. The predictions will be displayed on the console.

## Models

### Linear Regression

The Linear Regression model is a statistical approach used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In the context of cricket score prediction, it aims to find a linear relationship between various features of the match and the final score.

### Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is capable of handling non-linear relationships and capturing complex patterns in the data. In this project, Random Forest Regression is used to predict cricket scores based on the provided dataset.

### Random Forest Classifiers

Random Forest Classifiers are an extension of Random Forest Regression, but they are used for classification tasks. In this project, Random Forest Classifiers are employed to classify the outcome of cricket matches, such as predicting the winning team based on the given features.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning models that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. SVM aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes or predicts numerical values. In this project, SVM is utilized to predict cricket scores.

## Results

After running the prediction script, you will see the predicted scores or classification results based on the respective models. The performance metrics, such as accuracy, mean squared error, or classification reports, can be found in the console output.
